# blue-shop-api

The GraphQL API server for blue shop, an ambitious mock ecommerce website I am working on.
This uses Apollo server as a server, Prisma as an ORM and PostgreSQL as a database.

## Implemented features
* Pretty much finished designing the entire DB prisma schema.
* Designed the GraphQL schema and created most of the resolvers for queries.
